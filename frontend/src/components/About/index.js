                    hi :] I'm Denise. I'm a Biologist-turned-Software-Engineer. Before
                    pivoting to tech, I lived in the Kalahari Desert as a wildlife
                    researcher and aboard commercial fishing boats in the Bering Sea as a
                    fisheries biologist and worked as an environmental scientist in Los
                    Angeles, CA.
                </div>
                <div>I'm intense. I get stuff done. My tenacity knows no bounds.</div>
                <div>When I'm not mashing keys in VSCode, I'm usually hanging out with my cats, petting dogs that I encounter on my daily walks, or yelling into my mic when I'm playing video games.</div>
                <br/>
                <h3>Education:</h3>
                <div>University of California, Berkeley. Class of 2010.<br/>
                    Majors: Integrative Biology, Psychology</div>

                    Wildr is inspired by Flickr, but focused on wildlife and animals. Users can register for an account, post images by linking to the URL, create collections of images that can contain any users' images, and edit their public profile.

                <div>
                    I spent about a year and a half of my early scientific career as a field biologist. Wildr pays homage to my time spent aboard commercial fishing vessels as a fisheries biologist and my time as a research assistant in the Kalahari Desert.
